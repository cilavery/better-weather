In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### Deployment

## Thought Process
I wanted to utilize everything I learned during my training at Buildit. This meant implementing a scaleable file structure for my project. I also added sagas and redux as well as tests.

## TradeOffs
Used Create React App instead of configuring the build.

## With more time
 - Build the app without using an external boilerplate - I would like to get a better understanding of build configuration
 - Adding 404 page

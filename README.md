## Better Weather App
I am using node v11.4.0<br>
API keys have been placed into an .env file which have not been pushed into this repo.<br>

### npm start
---
To run this project locally, after obtaining api keys please git clone, cd better-weather, npm install<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### npm test
---
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### Deployment
---
This project is hosted on Github Pages at: [BetterWeather](https://cilavery.github.io/better-weather/)
I used Travis CI for continuous deployment and integration.

### Thought Process
---
I wanted to utilize everything I learned during my training at Buildit. This meant implementing a scaleable file structure for my project. I also added sagas and redux as well as tests.

### TradeOffs
---
Used Create React App instead of configuring the build.

### With more time
---
 - Build the app without using an external boilerplate - I would like to get a better understanding of build configuration
 - Adding 404 page
